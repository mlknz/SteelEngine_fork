// Each broadphase layer results in a separate bounding volume tree in the broad phase. You at least want to have
// a layer for non-moving and moving objects to avoid having to update a tree full of static objects every frame.
// You can have a 1-on-1 mapping between object layers and broadphase layers (like in this case) but if you have
// many object layers you'll be creating many broad phase trees, which is not efficient. If you want to fine tune
// your broadphase layers define JPH_TRACK_BROADPHASE_STATS and look at the stats reported on the TTY.
